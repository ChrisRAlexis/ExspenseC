# Ledgra Platform — Executive Summary

**Last Updated:** January 2026

---

## Unified Approval Policy Engine

Replaced the previous two-system approach with a single, intelligent policy engine. Admins define approval policies with conditions (amount thresholds, expense category, property/job site, employee role) and assign an action — either instant auto-approval or routing through a defined approval chain (sequential or parallel). The system evaluates policies by priority at submission time. This eliminates manual bottlenecks and gives leadership full control over approval logic without developer involvement.

## Integrated Financial Reporting

Budget tracking and spend analytics are now consolidated into a unified Reports hub, giving project managers and executives a single view of financial health across all properties and job sites.

---

## Streamlined Navigation & Property Access

Properties and job sites are now front-and-center in the main navigation, reflecting how frequently field teams and PMs reference them day-to-day.

---

## Payment Processing & Payout Management

The platform includes a full payout management system with batch processing, payment method tracking (check, bank transfer, ACH, credit card), reference number logging, and complete audit trails. The payment infrastructure is built with provider integration points, payment intent tracking, and transaction status management — ready for direct payment gateway connections (Stripe, PayPal, ACH processors) as the platform scales.
